## PAI class Presentation Template 
### To be used for works to be exposed in class sessions

This directory is organised as follows:

      .
      ├── bib          # Presentation bibliography and references
      ├── slides       # slides of your presentation (PDF is the preferred format)
      ├── tests        # Source code for tests (if applicable)
      ├── src          # Source code (add subdirectories if necessary) 
      
When you receive the link to this repository, clone it and use it to host all the material for the work to be done: slides, code, etc.

Upload the link to this public repository to the class assignment. This is required for the evaluation of the work.

Post the link to the repository in the PAI forum before the presentation date of the work, so that all students have access to the material in the exposition session.

Remove from the repository those directories that are not necessary for your work.
