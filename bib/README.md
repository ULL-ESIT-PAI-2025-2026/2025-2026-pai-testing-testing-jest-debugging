## 📚 References and Learning Resources

To deepen your understanding of software quality and testing, it is highly recommended to consult the following official sources and style guides:

### Core Literature & Methodology
* **[Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www-oreilly-com.accedys2.bbtk.ull.es/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/)**: The definitive guide by Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob"). It establishes that code is not "clean" unless it is covered by tests.

### Industry Style Guides
* **[Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)**: The gold standard for JS development, focusing on consistency and safety.
* **[Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)**: Adaptation of Google's rules for the TypeScript ecosystem.

### Technical Documentation
* **[Official Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)**: Comprehensive reference for Matchers, Mocks, Spies, and environment configuration.
* **[Clean Code TypeScript Repository](https://github.com/labs42io/clean-code-typescript)**: An excellent resource that adapts "Clean Code" concepts specifically for TypeScript.

## ✅ Professional Best Practices (F.I.R.S.T. Principles)

According to the principles outlined in *Clean Code*, a quality unit test must strictly follow the **F.I.R.S.T.** acronym:

* **Fast**: Tests should run so quickly that you don't hesitate to run them frequently.
* **Independent**: Tests should not depend on each other. One test should not set up the conditions for the next.
* **Repeatable**: Tests should be able to run in any environment (Local, CI/CD, Production) without failing due to external factors.
* **Self-Validating**: The test should have a clear boolean output (Pass/Fail). You shouldn't have to read a log file to know if it worked.
* **Timely**: Tests should be written *just before* the production code that makes them pass (**Test-Driven Development**).
